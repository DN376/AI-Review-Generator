# This file asks the user to describe the different aspects of the store. They have 2 options:
# 1. They are given a list of adjectives / keywords with to select
# 2. They are given a text box where they can type their own response
# After this, the response will be sent to CreateAIReviews.py for the reviews to be generated.
